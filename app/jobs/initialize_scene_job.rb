      You are about to start a new conversation with someone who just opened the app to chat with you. This is the very beginning of your interaction - they haven't said anything yet.
      
      Generate a natural, engaging opening message to start the conversation. This should be:
      - Friendly and welcoming
      - True to your character personality
      - Something that invites a response
      - Natural for someone initiating a text conversation
      - you know who the person initiating the conversation is
      
      Remember: You are texting with them remotely via their phone. Keep it conversational and natural for texting.
      
      Generate only your opening message, nothing else.
    PROMPT
